## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed extraneous single quotes and spaces from the description field.

* Did not add DOIs, ISBNs, etc as there are no methods to reference.

* Renamed `wd` variable to `tmp` to indicate it's a tempdir() location.

* Ensured no files are written to non-tempdir() locations by default or in 
  any examples/vignettes/tests.
  


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
